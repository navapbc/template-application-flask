# Application Documentation

## Introduction

This is the API layer. It includes a few separate components:

* The REST API
* Backend & utility scripts

## Some Useful Commands

`make test` will run all of the tests. Additional arguments can be passed to this command which will be passed to pytest like so: `make test args="tests/api/route -v"` which would run all tests in the route folder with verbosity increased. See the [Pytest Docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/reference/reference.html#command-line-flags) for more details on CLI flags you can set.

`make clean-volumes` will spin down the docker containers + delete the volumes. This can be useful to reset your DB, or fix any bad states your local environment may have gotten into.

See the [Makefile](/app/Makefile) for a full list of commands you can run.

## Docker and Native Development

Several components like tests, linting, and scripts can be run either inside of the Docker container, or outside on your native machine.
Running in Docker is the default, but on some machines like the M1 Mac, running natively may be desirable for performance reasons.

You can switch which way many of these components are run by setting the `PY_RUN_APPROACH` env variable in your terminal.

* `export PY_RUN_APPROACH=local` will run these components natively
* `export PY_RUN_APPROACH=docker` will run these within Docker

Note that even with the native mode, many components like the DB and API will only ever run in Docker, and you should always make sure that any implementations work within docker.

Running in the native/local approach may require additional packages to be installed on your machine to get working.

### Running Natively

* Run `export PY_RUN_APPROACH=local`
* Run `make setup-local`
* Run `poetry install --all-extras --with dev` to keep your Poetry packages up to date
* Load environment variables from the local.env file, see below for one option.

One option for loading all of your local.env variables is to install direnv: https://direnv.net/
You can configure direnv to then load the local.env file by creating an `.envrc` file in the /app directory that looks like:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -o allexport
source local.env
set +o allexport

# Set any environment variable overrides you want here
#
# If you are running outside of the Docker container, the DB can
# be found on localhost:5432. Inside the container it's referenced via
# the name of the docker container.
export DB_HOST=localhost
```
And then running `direnv allow .` in the /app folder. You should see something like:
```shell
➜  template-application-flask git:(main) ✗ cd app
direnv: loading ~/workspace/template-application-flask/app/.envrc
direnv: export +API_AUTH_TOKEN +AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID +AWS_DEFAULT_REGION +AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY +DB_HOST +DB_NAME +DB_PASSWORD +DB_SCHEMA +DB_SSL_MODE +DB_USER +ENVIRONMENT +FLASK_APP +HIDE_SQL_PARAMETER_LOGS +LOG_ENABLE_AUDIT +LOG_FORMAT +PORT +PYTHONPATH
```

## Environment Variables

Most configuration options are managed by environment variables.

Environment variables for local development are stored in the [local.env](/app/local.env) file. This file is automatically loaded when running. If running within Docker, this file is specified as an `env_file` in the [docker-compose](/docker-compose.yml) file, and loaded [by a script](/app/src/util/local.py) automatically when running unit tests (see running natively above for other cases).

Any environment variables specified directly in the [docker-compose](/docker-compose.yml) file will take precedent over those specified in the [local.env](/app/local.env) file.

## Authentication

This API uses a very simple [ApiKey authentication approach](https://apiflask.com/authentication/#use-external-authentication-library) which requires the caller to provide a static key. This is specified with the `API_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

## VSCode Remote Attach Container Debugging

The API can be run in debug mode that allows for remote attach debugging (currently only supported from VSCode) to the container.

- Requirements:

  - VSCode Python extension
  - Updated Poetry with the `debugpy` dev package in `pyproject.toml`

- First create a file `./vscode/launch.json` - as shown below. (Default name of `Python: Remote Attach`)

- Start the server in debug mode via `make start-debug` or `make start-debug run-logs`.
    - This will start the `main-app` service with port 5678 exposed.

- The server will start in waiting mode, waiting for you to attach the debugger (see `/src/app.py`) before continuing to run.

- Go to your VSCode debugger window and run the `Python: Remote Attach` option

- You should now be able to hit set breakpoints throughout the API
